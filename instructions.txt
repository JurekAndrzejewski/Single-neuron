Implement an artificial neuron. The neuron should take samples generated by a code from the
task 1 as its input and predict their class membership at its output. The neuron should be
trainable through the formula presented during the lecture:

Implemented neuron should allow for different activation functions for evaluation:
Heaviside step function (perceptron)
sigmoid (logistic function)
sin
tanh
sign
ReLu
leaky ReLu
